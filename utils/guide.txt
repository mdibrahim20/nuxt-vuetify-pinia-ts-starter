 Naming Best Practices		
	 1. Use clear and descriptive names	
	 - Avoid abbreviations and ambiguous names	
	 - Make sure the purpose and content of the file are clearly understood from the name	
	 2. Be consistent	
	 - Use the same naming pattern for files of the same type	
	 - Consistent naming conventions across the project	
	 3. Split files at the right granularity	
	 - Don't assign multiple responsibilities to a single file	
	 - Group related features together	
	 4. Utilizing index files	
	 - Use `index.ts` to group multiple exports	
	 - Keep your directory structure simple	
		
 Points to note		
	 File names should be written in English	
	 Do not use special characters or spaces	
	 File names should not be too short or too long	
	Avoid similarly named files in the same directory
